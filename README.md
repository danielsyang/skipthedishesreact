This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you find some general information about the libraries used and how to perform common tasks.

# Libraries

The project uses:

- React
- React Router
- React Redux
- Redux
- Redux Thunk
- Material UI
- PropTypes
- Moment


Those listed are just the main libraries, others are used as well.

# How to run
In order to run the project first install all javascript libraries and then instantiate a webpack-dev server.

```
  1) yarn install
  2) yarn start
```

# Observations
The project contains only a `yarn.lock`, so Yarn is mostly needed to install all dependecies correctly. Also keep in mind Node (npm) should be already installed on your machine.
